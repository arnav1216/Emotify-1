How'd you react to the idea of being suggested a playlist of songs to fit your mood best? Sounds an impossible feat right? Well not any longer! 
Emotify is a chrome extension which analyses the mood you are in and suggests you with suitable songs to fit your emotion best in order to help you feel relaxed :-) ^_^


Hope this idea is of some use to you!

How Emotify works?
1. Open new tab in Google Chrome
2. Click on the voice identification icon and speak out the mood you are in.
	eg: "I am happy/sad/excited/relaxed/angry".
2. Videos will appear to soothe your current mood.
3. Each time you refresh the page a new set of three songs will appear.
