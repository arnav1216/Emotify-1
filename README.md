# Emotify

How'd you react to the idea of being suggested a playlist of songs to fit your mood best? Sounds an impossible feat right? Well not any longer! 
Emotify is a WebApp which analyses the mood you are in and suggests you with suitable songs to fit your emotion best in order to help you feel relaxed :-) ^_^


Hope this idea is of some use to you!

How Emotify works?
1. Open the site "https://harshit2202.github.io/Emotify/index.html"..
2. Click on the voice identification icon and speak out the mood you are in.
	eg: "I am happy/sad/excited/relaxed/angry".
3. Videos will appear to soothe your current mood.
4. Each time you refresh the page a new set of three songs will appear.
